# Card Workout App

This app will display a random card from a standard deck when ran until the user taps on the stop button to land on a card that will specify what exercise to do and how many repetitions of that exercise to do. The number of repetitions is attributed to the value of the card and the type of exercise will be decided by the suit of the card. The full rule set is available with a quick tap of the rules button. The last button is the restart button so that the user can continue exercising to their hearts content.

**Created using Swift + Storyboard for iOS.**
